                    Scrat is a <strong>saber-toothed squirrel
                    </strong> who is obsessed with collecting acorns, constantly putting his life in danger to obtain
                    and defend them. He has his own stories in the films which are mostly independent of those of the
                    main characters, though the two
                    do intersect at times.Scrat constantly hunts for his acorn either to bury it or eat it, but fate
                    always gets in the way. He invariably ends up in humorous or painful situations: being struck by
                    lightning, pursued by avalanches,
                    and repeatedly knocked unconscious while fighting for his acorn. Yet he never gives up. Scrat
                    generally loses, except when he defeats a school of piranhas and successfully " battles " Sid.Scrat

                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ice_Age_characters#Scrat "> here</a>. The origin of
                    Scrat is disputed. Cartoon designer
                    Ivy Supersonic claims she created the character in 1999, after seeing a squirrel-rat hybrid in
                    Skidmore College's Case Green. She called her character "Sqrat" and says she presented the idea to
                    20th Century Fox movie executives.
                    A CNN report by Jeanne Moos of Ivy's discovery was aired in 2000, two years before Ice Age went into
                    development. Supersonic claims the studio's own documents actually identified the character in Ice
                    Age as "Sqrat", though
                    her creation was not sabre-toothed.

                    Scratte is also a saber-toothed squirrel. She is seen in the second trailer with Scrat battling with her
                    for the acorn by propelling
                    themselves down a gorge to reach the fallen acorn, and succeeding. Scratte is also seen as a love
                    interest for Scrat. Scratte's personality traits have been shown to be flirtatious, feisty, and
                    intelligent. She is equally determined
                    in catching the acorn and uses her feminine wiles to her advantage. She doesn't, however, seem to be
                    nearly as obsessed with acorns as her male counterpart, as she was shown trying to destroy the acorn
                    at the end of the film out
                    of jealousy. Scratte will often injure and manipulate Scrat in the process of retrieving it.
                    However, her attraction to him is implied and fully emerged when he saved her from falling into
                    lava. In the fourth movie, Scratte appeared
                    again in a cameo role as a Siren only to then be dismissed by a disinterested Scrat. In addition,
                    tons of her species live on Scratlantis.</p>
